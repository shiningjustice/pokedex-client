# Pokedex Client

This is the client repository for Phoebe's Pokedex application. 

## Getting Started

Run `npm install` to install dependencies. 

Run `npm start` to start the project. If my [Pokedex
server]('https://github.com/shiningjustice/pokedex-server) is running, it'll
automatically connect to it (makes calls to `http://localhost:8000/api`).

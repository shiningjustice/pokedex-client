# Pokedex Client

This is the client repository for Phoebe's Pokedex application. You can view it live [here](https://pbpokedex.now.sh/) (it might take a second to load the first time as it needs to wake up the free-tier Heroku servers). 

## Getting Started

Run `npm install` to install dependencies. 

Run `npm start` to start the project. If my [Pokedex
server](https://github.com/shiningjustice/pokedex-server) is running, it'll
automatically connect to it (makes calls to `http://localhost:8000/api`).
